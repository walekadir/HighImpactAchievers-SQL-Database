SQL database for managing 250 student records for High Impact Achievers Academy
High Impact Achievers Academy SQL Database



Project Overview

This repository contains a SQL database project for High Impact Achievers Academy, a Nigerian educational institution. The project demonstrates my ability to design and populate a student database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The database manages records for 250 students, including fields like `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

This is a portfolio project showcasing my skills as an aspiring data analyst, focusing on:
- Creating and structuring relational databases.
- Writing efficient SQL `INSERT` queries.
- Managing large datasets for educational applications.

Project Details

- Database: SQL Server (SSMS 18.0 or later)
- File: `student_database.sql` (contains `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements for 250 student records)
- Purpose: Simulate a student management system for tracking records and generating insights.
- Key Features:
  - Stores 250 unique student records.
  - Uses proper data types and constraints (e.g., `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`).
  - Supports queries for data analysis (e.g., student counts, registration trends).

Getting Started
